# roboadvisor

This code intends to simulate a Robo Advisor were a client is supposed to answer a questionaire so its investor profile can be determined via calculations that involve scores for each question.

Afterwards, based on Modern Portfolio Theory (Harry Markowitz, 1952) the client is assigned a combination of assets that maximize the Sharpe Ratio which establishes the reward between expected returns and expected risk. This portfolio in combination with the risk free rate is determined with a Monte Carlo Simulation.
